# Infrared Image Anomaly Detection

This notebook uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect anomalies in infrared images of solar modules. The dataset is sourced from [RaptorMaps' InfraredSolarModules](https://github.com/RaptorMaps/InfraredSolarModules), containing 20,000 images categorized into 12 classes, including 11 anomaly types and 1 "No-Anomaly" class.
